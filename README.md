# Welcome!

Welcome to The Feesh Bot! below is basically all you would need to know to get started with The Feesh Bot!

## About
This bot is a bot with games which some are wip, but I will add new games every week or so depending on their quality/difficulty


## Features

- **Game Collection**: Explore a collection of fun and exciting games, including classics and innovative new ones.
- **Weekly Updates**: I'm committed to enhancing your experience, so expect new games and features every week (or so), depending on their quality and user feedback.
- **Report Issues**: If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to create an issue on the GitHub repository. I'll be actively monitoring and addressing them as quickly as possible.
-  **Request features/games**: If you would like to see certain minigames added, you can go to my discord server and create a post that requests a minigame, but keep in mind that I might not add your game due to other things I need to add or because it would be too hard to create or because I just dont think it's a good idea
